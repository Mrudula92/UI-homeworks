 what is event propagation?
 Event propagation is a way of defining the element order when an event occurs. When you are having a parent and child elements and when you are trying to listen same eventType on both elments then even propagation will happen when event is performed.
 The two ways of event propagation in HTML DOM are
 1)Bubbling
 2)Capturing
 Event Bubbling:In bubbling the inner most element's event is handled first and then the outer
 i.e.,child event handler is invoked first and then the parent event handler is invoked
 Event Capturing:In capturing the outer most element's event is handled first and then the inner
 i.e., theparent event handler is invoked first and then the child event handler is invoked.
 If the captureFlag is not given or given false then event bubbling occurs by default. When it is given true event capturing occurs.It should be given in parent element.


event.stopPropagation
When it is given in case of bubbling only child event handler is invoked and when it is given in case of capturing parent event handler is invoked

event.stopImmediatePropagation
When it is given this will invoke last event handler.
