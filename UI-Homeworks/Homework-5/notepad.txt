1) Position properties:
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element like static, relative, absolute or fixed.
 static--if you do not want the top, left, right, bottom to be applied. Then we can use static
 relative--from the default position we can move top, left, right, bottom 
absolute--from the page level (somes times)
		--from parent relative element (if it find a parent relative element) --
		--scroll would work
fixed--always from the page level
	 --scroll would not work

2) float in css:
The float property specifies whether or not an element should float.It can be to right, left, none, initial or inherit. If the position is absolute then it ignores float.

3) Psuedo Classes and Psuedo Elements
Pseudo classes are used to define a specific state of an element
we use ":" syntax like p:hover
Pseudo elements are part of element being selected.
we use "::" syntax like p::after
