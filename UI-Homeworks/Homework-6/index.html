		<div class="col-md-8" style="border:1px solid black;background-color: hotpink">When my first child was born eight years ago, I stopped writing. I didn’t write a poem for the first year of her life. I was exhausted and anxious, and I held and bounced and swayed a colicky newborn all day. Who had time for poems? But even when my daughter began sleeping and I had some pockets of time, I was stuck. My life had changed completely, and I felt that the poems wanted to change—needed to change—but how? 

I remember feeling that the very temperature of my life had risen. There was nothing “cool” about motherhood. It was hot and raw. It was full of blood and shit and milk and tears. It was equal parts light and darkness. I didn’t know how to write that. I was wary of writing what might be dismissed as “mommy poems,” wary of sentimentality. 

I had a model for how to mother—I was lucky that way—but I needed poet models to show me how I might write the experience. I found them in Carrie Fountain, Brenda Shaughnessy, Rita Dove, Deborah Garrison, Beth Ann Fennelly, Arielle Greenberg, and Rachel Zucker. And, just when I needed her work the most, I rediscovered Sharon Olds.</div>
<div class="col-md-4" style="border:1px solid black;background-color: yellow">“Prayer During a Time My Son Is Having Seizures” was published in Poetry in September 1983. It’s a poem I could have encountered in high school, in college, or in graduate school, long before becoming a mother. And perhaps if I’d read it before having my daughter, I wouldn’t have felt so paralyzed as a poet when she was born.

“Finally, I just lean on the door-frame, a / woman without belief, praying,” the poem begins. “Please don’t let anything happen to him.”
