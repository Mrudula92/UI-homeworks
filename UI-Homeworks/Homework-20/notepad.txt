 In a directive -- 
   Scope -- shared scope, isolate scope, inherited scope

  Shared scope: All directives will share same model which is defined in a template. This is taken by default.
  Isolated scope: Every directive instance model would be independent.
  scope:{}
  In order to read attribute values in a isolate scope we can use 
  scope:{
  	attr:'@', -- read a value
  	attr:'=', -- read value as model
  	attr:'&'  -- read value as a funtion in reference
  }
