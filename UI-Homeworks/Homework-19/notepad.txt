One time data binding & two way data binding
Data Binding: It is the process for providing a connection between application UI and business logic. It can be one time data binding or two way data binding.
One time data binding is stable. Once the value is given it remains stable. It allows model or view to be updated once from te value setby the controller whereas two way data binding provides ability to effortlessly take the value of a property on scope and change it in view .
Syntax for one time data binding is:
{{::expression}}
Syntax for two way data binding is:
{{expression}}

ng-model, ng-app, ng-bind
ng-model - Here we are observing any changes in the input and updating the model
ng-bind - Here we are observing changes in the model and updating the view.
ng-app - It is used to define the owner of the application

Instead of ng-bind we use {{expression}} for two way data binding

$scope is used to define model in angular

We can define multiple controllers in an application
