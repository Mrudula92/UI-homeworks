Event Listener:
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Events are a part of the Document Object Model and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code.
Different type of events that can be performed are:
onclick()
onChange()
onMouseOver()
onMouseOut()
addEventListener: It cannot be applied to multiple elements at a time.Using events we can only assign single function so to add events we use addEventListener.
